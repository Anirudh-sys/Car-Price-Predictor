# 🚗 Car Price Predictor

Welcome to the **Car Price Predictor** repository! This project is a machine-learning-powered web application designed to provide price predictions for used cars based on various input features. The app leverages data-driven insights to assist users in estimating car prices accurately.

## 🚀 Live Demo
Check out the live app here: [Car Price Predictor](https://car-price-predictor-anirudh.streamlit.app/)

## 🧠 How It Works
The app uses a trained machine learning model to analyze input data about a car's specifications and predict its price. This is achieved by leveraging historical data on car prices and their respective features, applying a regression model for continuous price prediction.

## 📋 Key Features
- **Customizable Inputs**: Adjust car features, such as make, model, mileage, year, fuel type, transmission, etc., to get an estimated price.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: The model processes inputs in real time, displaying an updated prediction with each change.
- **Intuitive UI**: Simple, user-friendly interface built with Streamlit to ensure easy navigation and interaction.
- **Advanced Model**: A machine learning model optimized to deliver reliable predictions based on various car attributes.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for building the app.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for creating an interactive, data-centric front-end.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning library for training and deploying the prediction model.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Joblib**: For model serialization and loading.

## 🗂️ Project Structure
- `data/`: Dataset files used for training and evaluation.
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb` files) with data analysis and model training code.
- `app.py`: Main Streamlit application script.
- `models/`: Contains serialized models used for predictions (ensure to add these files as per instructions).
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all necessary dependencies for easy setup.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-price-predictor.git
   cd car-price-predictor
   ```

2. **Set up the environment**:
   Make sure to have Python installed (Python 3.7+ recommended). Then install dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Streamlit app locally**:
   Start the app by running:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:8501`.

## 📊 Model and Dataset

### Model
The prediction model is based on a regression algorithm trained to understand the relationships between car features and their prices. The model has been tuned for optimal performance and accuracy.

### Dataset
The model was trained on a comprehensive dataset of car listings, including fields like mileage, year, brand, engine size, and transmission type. Data preprocessing was handled with **Pandas** for consistency and normalization, ensuring high-quality model performance.

## 🧩 Future Enhancements
- **Car Comparison**: Enable users to compare different car models based on features and price.
- **Car Value Depreciation Rate**: Analyze how different factors affect car value depreciation over time.
- **Car Recommendation System**: Offer personalized car recommendations based on user preferences and budget.
- **User Reviews and Ratings**: Allow users to submit and view reviews for different car models, adding a community aspect.
- **Car Financing Calculator**: Add a tool to estimate monthly payments based on loan amount, interest rate, and loan duration.
